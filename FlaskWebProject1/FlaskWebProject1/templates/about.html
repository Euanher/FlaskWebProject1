<p>Welcome to our Trivia Game!</p>

<p>In this game, you'll interact with a chatbot powered by Amazon Q and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The goal is to answer trivia questions accurately based on the context provided by the system.</p>

<p><strong>Game Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You will be presented with trivia questions in various categories.</li>
    <li>Respond to the question with your best answer.</li>
    <li>The system will use a combination of Amazon Q and RAG technology to provide context and help in the answering process.</li>
    <li>Be aware that the chatbot is designed to stay within the game framework and not exceed the scope of the trivia game.</li>
    <li>Enjoy the game, and good luck!</li>
</ul>

<p>The game uses OpenAI GPT-3 integrated into the backend, but it is bound by the trivia rules and framework, so the AI will not exceed the scope of the gameâ€™s capabilities.</p>
